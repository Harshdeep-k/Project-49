            <li>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</li><br>
            <li> Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.</li><br>
            <li>Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.</li><br>
            <li> Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot sand.</li>

        <ol>
            <li> Most lizards have fairly unremarkable feet. In the majority of species, they're comprised of four to five toes that can move independently of each other—just as ours do.</li><br>
            <li> They mainly change color in order to communicate or regulate body temperature</li><br>

    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.origami.me/cicada/"> <img src="images/cicada.png" width="200px" height="200px"> </a>
    <p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
            <li> They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</li>
            <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>
            <li>They improve lawns by digging tunnels that allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies put nitrogen into the soil.</li>

    <h3 class="heading"> PIGEON</h3>
    <hr>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.origami.me/pigeon/"> <img src="images/pigeon.png" width="200px" height="200px"> </a>
    <p> 
    1) Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition.<br>
    2) Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.<br>
    3) Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.<br>
    4) Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.<br></p>

    <p>
        <ol>
        <li> The origins of Hug A Bear Day are unclear but it may be connected with the day in November 1902 when Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear on a hunting trip in Mississippi.</li><br>
        <li> Winnie the Pooh was based on a real bear</li><br>
        <li> Jackie Miley, from Hilly City, South Dakota, has the world’s biggest teddy bear collection. As of 2012, she owned 8,026 cuddly bears.</li><br>
        <li> Magellan T. Bear became the first teddy bear in space when he boarded Space Shuttle Discovery in 1995. But he wasn’t just a bear on holiday—he was the “education specialist” on the mission, having been a project for a Colorado elementary school.</li><br>
